# Titanic-Dataset-ML-Project
Using different ML models to predict whether a person survives on ther Titanic Ship wreckage.
After performing EDA and imputing missing values,i used different ML models on the Dataset and through grid search cv and forward selection, i found the best performing model. Through this i was able to achieve 86% accuracy on validation data and 75% accuracy on test data.
# About Dataset
The dataset is available on https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data.
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
Our aim is to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
